# Star Wars Game

This is a simple javascript RPG game. Your first choice is the character you will play and then you may choose among the remaining three characters which to attack first. Both you and your enemy will get one attack per turn and your goal is to defeat all three enemies in succession. Not all characters can win, so be careful which you choose.
