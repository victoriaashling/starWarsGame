# starWarsGame

Basically, you play exactly as you do in the example game.

It's not possible to both win and lose with each player, but I used the math from the example because I didn't feel like trying to figure that out and I figured the coding was more important anyway.

It's still pretty messy -- I didn't really have time to clean it up and I know I didn't take full advantage of the ability to use objects. But I intend to go through and make it cleaner this week when I have more time.
